  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>Cronuts are the doughnuts that make people go nuts! They have the shape and flavor of a doughnut, yet feature the crispy, flaky texture of a buttery croissant.</p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>½ cup warm water (105 degrees F/41 degrees C)</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>2 ½ tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Place yeast into the mixing bowl of a large stand mixer. Whisk in warm water and let stand until a creamy foam forms on top, about 5 minutes. Add milk, sugar, 2 tablespoons melted butter, egg, salt, vanilla extract, and nutmeg. Whisk mixture thoroughly. Pour flour on top of liquid ingredients. Place mixing bowl onto mixer.</li>
    <li>Attach dough hook to mixer and knead on low speed until dough comes together in a ball and becomes soft and sticky, about 3 minutes. Dough will stick to the hook and pull away from the side of the bowl.</li>
    <li>Transfer dough to a floured work surface, knead 2 or 3 times, and shape into a ball. Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for 20 minutes to let gluten relax.</li>
    
  </ol>
